## Introduction

Magic Match is a memory game. The game is very simple: you can flip two cards, and if they match, they are still flipped, and if they don't match, they turn back. On the bottom of the screen, there is a turn counter that shows how many turns the user took to complete the game. And finally, there is the "New Game" button, which resets the current game.
